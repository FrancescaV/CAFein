This test_suite computes the non-adiabatic eigenfunctions of a 7Msun MS star
at Z = 0.03. Specifically, it computes the p2 - eigenmode.

To compute a different mode you need to change the following parameters in acc_and_dim.dat:

- eigenv_r. Real eigenfrequency 
- eigenv_i. Imaginary eigenfrequency

*** Some details not critical for running the code 
***************************************************
R is permuted whenever ||R|| has a maximum when going from the surface to the fitting point
(we really care about the surface value). During the integration from the center to the 
fitting point R is permuted whenever ||R|| goes above the user-defined limit you set.
For this reason, you can set the Riccati limit to whatever you want, and it will only be 
read during the integration from the center to the fitting point. The Riccati elements Rij 
are always interpolated using Steffen.

If you want to do a plot like the one in Fig.4 in CAFein's paper, you must compute the
eigenfunctions only from the fitting point to the surface (set flag 35 to 0).
